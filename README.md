A Web Application Vulnerability Scanner is a security tool designed to identify potential vulnerabilities within web applications. It simulates various types of attacks, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Command Injection, to detect weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious actors. The scanner provides a comprehensive analysis of the web application's security posture, highlighting critical issues that need to be addressed. By automating the vulnerability assessment process, it helps developers and security professionals ensure their applications are secure before deployment. This tool is essential for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of web applications in today's digital landscape.
